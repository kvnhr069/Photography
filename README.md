# Photography Homepage

Yes! After learning Bootstrap on my own for a short time I was able to build my very first Bootstrap website. The site is about photography. I used my own name and social media within the footer for placement. 

# UPDATES
I've planned some updates for the site. I want to publish an interactive image gallery and more stuff - as soon as I'll get more knowledge in JavaScript.
